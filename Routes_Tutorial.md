# Gin Web Server: Route Setup Tutorial

Setting up routes in a Gin-based Go server is straightforward. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of route definition, organization, and advanced topics like grouping and middlewares.

## Directory Structure

```bash
golang-gin-server/
├── api/
│   ├── handlers/                   # <-- This is where handlers would go
│   │   ├── user_handler.go         # Handler functions related to users
│   │   ├── product_handler.go      # Handler functions related to products
│   │   └── ...                     # Other handlers
│   ├── routes/
│   └── middlewares/
```

## 1. **Basic Route Setup**:

With Gin, you typically create a router instance and then define endpoints with associated handlers. Given your handler structure inside `src/handlers`, routes can be set up in the main application entry point or a dedicated routes file.

## 2. **Organizing Routes**:

While defining routes directly in `main.go` is possible, it's cleaner to have a dedicated function or file for this purpose, especially as your application grows.

## 3. **Example Setup**:

Assuming a `main.go` either at the root or inside `cmd/server/`, here's a route setup:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"your_project_path/src/handlers" // Replace with your project's path
)

func setupRouter() *gin.Engine {
	r := gin.Default() // New Gin router instance

	// Link the endpoint to the handler
	r.GET("/health", handlers.HealthCheck)

	return r
}

func main() {
	r := setupRouter()
	r.Run(":8080") // Start server on port 8080
}
```

In this setup:
- `setupRouter` function configures the routes.
- We create a new Gin router instance.
- Bind the `/health` endpoint to the `HealthCheck` handler.
- In `main`, we configure routes and start the server.

## 4. **Expanding Routes**:

Add more routes by defining handlers in `src/handlers` and linking them:

```go
r.GET("/users", handlers.GetUsers)
r.POST("/users", handlers.CreateUser)
r.GET("/users/:id", handlers.GetUserByID)
```

## 5. **Grouping Routes**:

For organization, especially with multiple related routes, use Gin's grouping:

```go
usersGroup := r.Group("/users")
{
	usersGroup.GET("/", handlers.GetUsers)
	usersGroup.POST("/", handlers.CreateUser)
	usersGroup.GET("/:id", handlers.GetUserByID)
}
```

## 6. **Middlewares**:

Gin supports middlewares, functions that run before the request reaches the handler. They can be applied globally, per group, or per route:

```go
r.Use(someGlobalMiddleware())

usersGroup := r.Group("/users")
usersGroup.Use(someUserSpecificMiddleware())
{
	usersGroup.GET("/", handlers.GetUsers)
	// ... other user routes
}
```

## Summary

Setting up routes with Gin is intuitive. You define handlers, create a router, bind endpoints to handlers, and start the server. Grouping and middlewares enhance organization and functionality.
